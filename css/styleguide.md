### From within local folder run these commands:

## How to use it?
In order to use this collection, you first need to do following steps:

1. Copy your SVG's to _icons16_ folder
2. In your shell run _gulp_ command

Gulp process will do the following
- It will create icon fonts and will copy them to _fonts/vxIcons_ folder
- It will create SCSS styles within that folder
- It will create styleGuide for your icons by using KSS node and will place it in *styleGuide* folder


## File Revving
These font building pack usess font revving, which means that it will add different font version for each build. Apache will be able to read and refresh fonts every time they are rebuilt, so keep in mind that .htaccess file.
